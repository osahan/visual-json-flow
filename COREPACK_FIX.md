# Corepack Fix for GitHub Actions

## Issue
The GitHub Actions workflows were failing because:
- The `cache: yarn` option in `setup-node` was trying to use the system Yarn (1.22.22)
- This happened before `corepack enable` was run
- The project requires Yarn 4.0.0 as specified in `package.json`

## Root Cause
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    cache: yarn  # ‚ùå This tries to use system Yarn before Corepack
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Yarn Cache from setup-node
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    # ‚úÖ Removed cache: yarn
```

### 2. Added Yarn Version Verification
```yaml
- name: Enable Corepack
  run: corepack enable
- name: Verify Yarn version
  run: yarn --version  # ‚úÖ Should show 4.0.0
```

### 3. Applied to Both Workflows
- ‚úÖ **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- ‚úÖ **Deploy workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

## Expected Behavior
After this fix:
1. **Corepack enables** Yarn 4.0.0
2. **Yarn version verification** confirms correct version
3. **Dependencies install** successfully
4. **Build process** completes without errors

## Testing Locally
```bash
corepack enable
yarn --version  # Should show 4.0.0
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn build
```

The CI should now pass successfully! üéâ
