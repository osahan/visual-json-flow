# CI Build Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Corepack Configuration**
**Problem:** The CI workflows weren't enabling Corepack, which is required for Yarn 4.0.0
**Fix:** Added `corepack enable` step to both CI and deploy workflows

### 2. **Redundant Build Step**
**Problem:** CI workflow was running `yarn workspace visual-json-flow-demo build` after `yarn build`
**Fix:** Removed redundant build step since `yarn build` already builds all workspaces

### 3. **Missing TypeScript Configuration**
**Problem:** No root `tsconfig.json` file for the monorepo
**Fix:** Created proper TypeScript configuration files:
- Root `tsconfig.json` with project references
- Demo app `tsconfig.json` without strict rootDir

### 4. **GitHub Pages Permissions**
**Problem:** Deploy workflow lacked proper permissions for GitHub Pages
**Fix:** Added required permissions and updated to use modern GitHub Pages actions

### 5. **Workflow Conflicts**
**Problem:** Both CI and deploy workflows running on all pushes
**Fix:** Separated concerns - CI runs on all pushes/PRs, deploy only runs on main branch

## Files Modified

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Added `corepack enable` step
- Removed redundant build command
- Added proper step names for clarity

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Added required permissions for GitHub Pages
- Updated to use modern GitHub Pages actions
- Added environment configuration
- Removed pull request trigger (deploy only on main)

### `tsconfig.json` (new)
- Root TypeScript configuration for monorepo
- Project references to all packages and apps

### `apps/demo/tsconfig.json` (new)
- Demo app TypeScript configuration
- Proper extends from base config

## Current Status

âœ… **All builds now pass locally**
âœ… **TypeScript compilation works**
âœ… **GitHub Actions workflows properly configured**
âœ… **GitHub Pages deployment ready**

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix CI build issues and GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor the Actions tab** to ensure all workflows pass

3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings if not already done

The CI should now pass successfully! ðŸŽ‰
