# Visual JSON Flow

A schemaâ€‘aware, **workflowâ€‘style** JSON editor for nonâ€‘technical users.

Give it a **JSON Schema**, get a **visual canvas** of nodes and lanes that makes structure obvious at a glance â€” not a wall of form fields.

> MVP status: objects, arrays (as lanes), scalars, and `oneOf` choices; Ajv validation with perâ€‘node badges; Vite demo app.
